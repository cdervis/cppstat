This feature allows you to give a reason as to why a function is deleted.

When you try to call such a function, the compiler can issue the reason as the message.

Example:

```
struct UniquePtr {
    UniquePtr() = default;

    // Copy constructor
    UniquePtr(const UniquePtr&) = delete(
        "A UniquePtr manages unique resources and is therefore non-copyable. \
         Please std::move it instead.");
};
```

Attempting to copy-construct an object of this type may result in the following compilation error:

```raw
UniquePtr.h:5: error: call to deleted constructor of 'UniquePtr':

    A UniquePtr manages unique resources and is therefore non-copyable.
    Please std::move it instead.
    
    UniquePtr un2 = un;
                ^     ~~
                
main.cpp:1: note: 'UniquePtr' has been explicitly marked deleted here:
    UniquePtr(const UniquePtr&)
    ^
```
