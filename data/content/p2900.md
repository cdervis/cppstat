This language feature allows adding contract assertions to C++ code.

*(from the proposal)*

There are three kinds of contract assertions: **pre**condition assertions,
**post**condition assertions and assertion statements.

Precondition and postcondition assertions are placed on function declarations and
collectively called *function contract assertions*.

Assertion statements are placed inside function bodies.
The following example contains all three kinds of contract assertions:

```
int f(const int x)
    pre (x != 1)              // a precondition assertion
    post(r: r == x && r != 2) // a postcondition assertion
                              // r names the result object of f
{
    contract_assert(x != 3); // an assertion statement
}
```

When the predicate of an assertion evaluates to `false`, a contract
violation has been identified. This will notify the contract-violation handler, which can be
user-defined. The default contract-violation handler will terminate the program
when it is notified.
